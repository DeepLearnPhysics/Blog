Summary: News from last 2 weeks, new meeting time, publications and talk/job opportunities!

There was no meeting this week, but here's a flush of news to avoid a clog.

### Meeting:
Next meeting
Let's plan on **September 5th 11:30AM Fermilab/Chicago (US/Central) time**.
Please send me what awesome you can present. We all want to see your progress!

### Recent Neutrino-ML Papers
* **EXO-200** ... using deep neural nets for energy and position estimation of the signal
    * [arXiv:1804.09641](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09641) or [JINST](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/13/08/P08023/meta) 
    * You can find Manuel, one of authors, on our slack to ask questions!

    * [arXiv:1805.00905](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00905)
    * I have not read this yet! but was introduced in Teppei's neutrino xs newsletter (if you are into nu-xs and not on the list, I recommend)
* **Everyone dance now** ... [arXiv:1808.07371](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07371)
    * As Lisa says, "Geeks and nerds can dance!", very relevant to us all. Make sure you train your network before your next date!

### Job/Conference/Funding opportunities
As usual, thanks to Gabe Perdue for sharing many opportunities! Checkout deep.learn.physics slack organization for more updates.

* **Job opportunities**
    * [Assistant Computer Scientist](https://careers.peopleclick.com/careerscp/client_argonnelab/external/jobDetails.do?functionName=getJobDetail&jobPostId=5880&localeCode=en-us) (postdoc and beyond) @ Argonne National Lab
    * [ML/Neutrino Research Associate](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/11530) (postdoc equivalent) @ SLAC National Lab
* **Conference opportunities**
    * [Machine Learning for Science Workshop at LBNL](https://sites.google.com/lbl.gov/ml4sci/)
    * [Next steps in Quantum Science for HEP @ Fermilab](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/17199/)
    * [Phystat-Nu Workshop @ CERN, Geneva](https://indico.cern.ch/event/735431/)
    * [D-wave conference in Knoxville @ Oak Ridge](http://qbna3.eventzilla.net/web/event?eventid=2138962884)
* **Funding opportunities**
	* [NSF Moore's travel grants](https://www.aps.org/programs/innovation/moore/visitor.cfm) (Thanks to Flip Tanedo @ UC Reverside!)
		* Get up to $5k for 1-3 week visit, or $10k for 4-6 week visit to inspire and collaborate with colleagues at different institutions (come to SLAC! :) )
	* [Pioneer grants](https://pioneer.app) (non academic)
		* The same people organized "AI Grant" contacted me to spread this. This grant is a bit wider opportunity: no need to be AI, any ML projects (and beyond) count. "Apply with any project you need help with. After 30 days, the best players will receive $5,000, a round-trip ticket to Silicon Valley, and access to mentorship from some of the worldâ€™s most successful individuals." (from their website)
