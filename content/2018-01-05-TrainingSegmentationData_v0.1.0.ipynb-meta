Summary: A demonstration to train U-ResNet (convolutional neural network for semantic segmentation) for track/shower separation using a (practice) public data sample (v0.1.0). I show the network's learning curve as well as visualization of how the network's performance improved during the training on a specific track/shower sample image. This notebook can also serve as a generic example of configuring larcv IO to train a semantic segmentation network.
