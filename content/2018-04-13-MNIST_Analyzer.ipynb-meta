Summary: See Part 1 first!  There, I trained an mnist classifier.  Here, I restore the trained network, run the network on the validation script, and do some analysis on the output. This is meant as a template for new users to see "how do I actually use a trained network?" Lots of this information exists elsewhere too, I've just tried to consolidate the basics.
